If you're into western country folk, you're at the right place. Although, this is a video of a live concert that I just attended, I bet you'd get to know a start for real and he being in the River Festival is something you'd wanna live by. This is February 23, 2020, James Princep Memorial. At an open concert organised by the Alliance Francais called for a beautiful time for losing oneself amidst the crowd. The video is pretty trippy edited, but just like I said, you are home if you like the music.
