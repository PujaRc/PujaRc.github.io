James Princep Memorial, February 23, 2020. The River Festival. Arko Mukherjee got on the stage with a jovial smile greeting all of his friends that attended his concert. I was late to the concert, but by the time I reached he was singing "Haye Bhalobashi" by Mohiner Ghoraguli. Just when every soul felt connected to his voice he made his friends join with him in chorus. I stood very close to the stage, but he never got a glimpse of me. The photograph has been taken by me then. I am attaching the link to the YouTube video, it's got a poor audio quality and has been filmed by someone else I possible would not know. Here's something I know, nonetheless, you'll love it as much as I did.
