The performance started with a beautiful collaboration of dance and a folk rendition "Baba Moulana" by Arko Mukherjee himself. This is James Princep Memorial cordially celebrating the River Festival. The open concert followed a lot more of beautiful folk songs all sung in unison as if the people were one voice! It's truly said that art brings people together. Minds both different and alike dwell in the music. This was a beautiful period of a transient "Renaissance" for me. Having being able to attend such a beautiful initiative is praiseworthy! Oh and notice how he blends many songs into one just like the minds of his audiece!
